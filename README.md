### Abstract
Snow Much Fun is a social weather site, where data from all over Colorado is collected and displayed. Here users can view and comment on different locations to share more detailed updates on conditions, crowds, activites and more. 

### Running
This website is live [here.](http://snowmuchfun.sportsontheweb.net/) The site can also be run locally. To do this you need to create a new database (our host prevents any external communication), and then simply run a PHP server, then launch index.php.

### Contributing
Please use the issues tab to contribute code and help build the project. 

### Version
There was a signifigant rewrite of the site on May 1st. To view the old version, you can visit commit [105](https://github.com/JarrettPhilips/SoftwareDevGroupProject/tree/6cd0360b96968b8fb0b492ed4a14ed25892ae271)
